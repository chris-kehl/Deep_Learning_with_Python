# Deep_Learning_with_Python
Projects from the tutorials learned in the book Deep Learning with Python 2nd Edition

These notebooks are projects and tutorials form the book i'm currently reading "Deep Learning with Python 2nd Edition". We start with our first example using Mnist.  My plans are to build upon my spider application written with fastAi.
